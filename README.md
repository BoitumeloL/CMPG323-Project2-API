# CMPG323-Project2-API
This repository is for Project 2 which is making an API that will manage the IoT devices

## API DESCRIPTION
This API will be used as a system to keep track of IoT devices in an organisation. It will allow the users to record and store data about these devices.

## METHODS IN API
The database is scaffolded and we have 3 controllers that represent the 3 tables (Category, Devices and zones) in the database. These controllers have the methods: GET, POST, PUT and DELETE.
The methods are described below:
### GET:

### POST:

### PUT:

### DELETE:

## STORAGE OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION AND FILES THAT GIT SHOULD NOT TRACK
A .gitignore file will be used to ignore files that need not be tracked by git, such files are (and are not limited to) connection.udl, .vs, bin, etc

##IMPLEMENTATION OF SECURITY 

##BRANCHING STRATEGY
The git workflow branching strategy is used as mentioned in CMPG323- Overview.
All of the work, such as develeoping the API and adding the required features is done in the development branch and then pushed into the main branched (ready for production - in this case - the final project)
